In HTML, a tag is used to define the start and end of an element, such as a paragraph or a heading. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets. For example, the start tag for a paragraph is <p> and the end tag is </p>. 

An element, on the other hand, includes the start tag, the end tag, and the content in between. For example, in the paragraph <p>This is a paragraph.</p>, <p> is the start tag, </p> is the end tag, and "This is a paragraph." is the content. The whole thing together is considered an HTML element.
