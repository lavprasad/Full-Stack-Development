Comments in HTML are used to explain the code and to make it more understandable for others (or even for yourself at a later time). They does not get render by the browser and do not affect the final output of the webpage. 

Comments can be very useful when you're debugging your code, or when you're working on a team and you want to leave notes for your teammates about what your code is doing.

Example of how to use comments in an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- This is a comment. It will not be displayed in the browser. -->
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

    <!-- <p>This paragraph will not be displayed.</p> -->

</body>
</html>

In this example, the text within the `<!-- -->` tags is a comment. It will not be displayed in the browser.
